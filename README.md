Game idea with brainwaves

(Do the thing here)[https://bupeldox.github.io/BrainWaves/public/]


- Range of reader -> can read people on roof/across river
- Reader penetration -> Through walls
- Access to functions (this might be confusing as they might not know that they dont have it, but some are so different eg:x+sin(t), x^-1, x%2, |x| )
- Read only (Current thoughts) > ask yes no qs > ask deeper qs/(wwwwwh) (predefinded soz, could use ai lol, give it a backstory).
- Do stuff with environment to get them to think about what you want to know.
